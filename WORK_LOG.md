# App Manager Work Log - 2025-09-23

This log summarizes the work done on the App Manager application.

## Objective

The main goal was to fix and improve the "app archiving" functionality.

## Changes Made

1.  **Fixed "Archive" Button in Selection Menu:**
    - The "archive" button in the multi-selection menu was not working because its click event was not being handled.
    - I added the necessary code to `MainActivity.java` to handle the click event.
    - I also added a confirmation dialog to this action to prevent accidental archiving, making the user experience consistent with the "uninstall" action.

2.  **Fixed `MainBatchOpsHandler`:**
    - The `MainBatchOpsHandler` was not aware of the "archive" button, which caused the button to be always disabled.
    - I modified the handler to correctly enable and disable the "archive" button based on the app selection.

3.  **Added "Archive" Button to App Details Page:**
    - As requested, I added an "archive" button to the app details page (`AppInfoFragment`).
    - This provides another way for the user to archive a single app.
    - This button also has a confirmation dialog.

4.  **Implemented Shizuku Support for Archiving:**
    - I added support for Shizuku to the app.
    - I created a `ShizukuUtils.java` class to handle Shizuku-related operations.
    - The `opArchive` method in `BatchOpsManager.java` was modified to use Shizuku to execute the `pm uninstall -k` command if Shizuku is available. If not, it falls back to the previous method.

5.  **Added Detailed Logging:**
    - To help diagnose why the archive operation was failing, I added more detailed logging to the `opArchive` method. It now logs the exit code and standard error of the command if it fails.

## Build Failures and Fixes

- The build failed once due to a mistake in the `MainBatchOpsHandler.java` file. I had used the `mArchiveMenu` variable before it was defined. I corrected this by properly defining and initializing the variable.
- The build failed a second time due to an incompatible type error in `AppInfoFragment.java`. I fixed this by converting a `List` to an `ArrayList`.

## Current Status

All the requested code changes have been implemented and saved in the `app_archive_fix.patch` file. The app is ready to be built and tested.
