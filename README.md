# App Manager
![Debug Build](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/workflows/Debug%20Build/badge.svg)

Yet another android package manager and viewer but...

- It is free and open source
- It has material design (and a nice UI)
- It doesn't have any useless permissions
- It doesn't connect to the internet (internet permission is required for ADB mode)
- It tries to display as much information as possible in the main window
- It lists activities, broadcast receivers, services, providers, permissions, signatures, shared libraries, etc. of any app
- It can launch (exportable) activities, create (customizable) shortcuts
- It can block any activities, broadcast receivers, services or providers you like with native import/export as well as Watt and Blocker import support (requires root)
- It can revoke permissions that are considered dangerous (requires root/ADB)
- It can disable app ops that are considered dangerous (requires root/ADB)
- It can scan for trackers in apps and list (all or only) tracking classes (and their code dump)
- It can generate dynamic manifest for any app
- It can be used to view/edit/delete shared preferences of any app (requires root)
- It displays running processes/apps (requires root/ADB)
- It displays your app usage, data usage and app storage info (requires “Usage Access” permission)
- Apk files can be shared (hence the use of a provider)
- It can be used to clear app data or app cache (requires root/ADB)
- Batch operations: clear app data, disable run in background, disable/kill/uninstall apps
- One-click operations: block ads/tracker components, block components by signature, block multiple app ops

...and other minor features such as installing/uninstalling/updating/enabling/disabling apps, displaying app installation info, opening on F-Droid, Aurora Droid or Aurora Store.

It basically combines the features of 5 or 6 apps that any tech-savvy person needs to use in order to have a life.

See the instructions page within the app for more information on how to use the app.
