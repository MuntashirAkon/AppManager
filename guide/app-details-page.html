It should be noted that a component that is marked as disabled does not always mean that it is disabled by the user: It could be disabled by the system as well or marked as disabled in the app manifest. Also, all components of a disabled app are considered disabled by the system (and by App Manager as well)</li> <li><code style="background-color:#FF8017;color:#000;">Vivid orange (day)</code> or <code style="background-color:#FF8017;color:#FFF;">very dark orange (night)</code> - Tracker or ad components</li> <li><code style="background-color:#EA80FC;color:#000;">Soft magenta (day)</code> or <code style="background-color:#431C5D;color:#FFF;">very dark violet (night)</code> - Currently running services</li></ul> <h2 id="app-info-tab"><a href="#app-info-tab" class="header-anchor">#</a> App Info Tab</h2> <p><strong>App Info</strong> tab contains general information about an app. It also lists many actions that can be performed within this tab. A complete description is given below:</p> <h3 id="general-information"><a href="#general-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Information</h3> <p>The list below is in the same order as listed in the App Info tab.</p> <ul><li><strong>App Icon.</strong> The application icon, if an app doesn't have a icon, the system default icon is displayed.</li> <li><strong>App Label.</strong> The application label or application name.</li> <li><strong>Version.</strong> Application version is divided into two parts. The first part is called <em>version name</em>, the format of this part varies but it often consists of multiple integers separated by dots. The second part is called <em>version code</em> and it is closed under first brackets. Version code is an integer which is usually used to differentiate between app versions (as version name can often be unreadable by a machine). In general, new version of an app has higher version code than the old ones. For instance, if <code>123</code> and <code>125</code> are two version codes of an app, we can say that the latter is more updated than the former because the version code of the latter is higher. For applications that depend on platforms (mobile, tabs, desktops, etc.), these version numbers can be misleading as they use prefixes for each platform.</li> <li><strong>Tags.</strong> (Also known as tag clouds) Tags include the basic, concised and most useful information of an app. Tags contain <em>tracker info</em> (i.e., number of trackers), <em>app type</em> (user app or system app and whether the app is an updated version of the system app), <em>split apk info</em> (i.e., number of splits), <em>debuggable</em> (the app is a debug version), <em>test only</em> (the app is a test only app), <em>large heap</em> (the app has requested a large heap size), <em>stopped</em> (the app is force stopped), <em>disabled</em> (the app is disabled) and <em>no code</em> (the app doesn't have any code associated with it). The importance of including <em>test only</em> and <em>debuggable</em> is that app with these properties can do additional tasks or these apps can be <code>run-as</code> without root which can cause potential security problems if these apps store any private information. <em>large heap</em> denotes that the app will be allocated a higher amount of memory (RAM) if needed. While this may not be harmful for most cases, any suspicious apps requesting large heap should be taken seriously.</li> <li><strong>Horizontal Action Panel.</strong> This is a action panel containing various actions regarding the app. See <a href="#horizontal-action-panel">below</a> for a complete list of actions available there.</li> <li><strong>Paths &amp; Directories.</strong> Contains various information regarding application paths including <em>app directory</em> (where the apk files are stored), <em>data directories</em> (internal, device protected and externals), <em>split apk directories</em> (along with the split names), and <em>native JNI library</em> (if present). JNI libraries are used to invoke native codes usually written in C/C++. Use of native library can make the app run faster or help an app use third-pary libraries written using languages other than Java like in most games. You can also open these directories using your favourite file managers (provided they support it and have necessary permissions) by clicking on the launch icon on the right-hand side of each item.</li> <li><strong>Data Usage Since Last Boot.</strong> A rather self explanatory option. But beware that due to some issues, the results might often be misleading and simply wrong. This part remains hidden if <em>Usage Access</em> permission is not granted in newer devices.</li> <li><strong>Storage &amp; Cache.</strong> Displays information regarding the size of the app (apk files), data and cache. In older devices, size of external data, cache, media and obb folders are also displayed. This part remains hidden if <em>Usage Access</em> permission is not granted in newer devices.</li> <li><strong>More Info.</strong> Displays other information such as
<ul><li><strong>SDK.</strong> Displays information related to the Android SDK. There are two (one in old devices) values: <em>Max</em> denotes the target SDK and <em>Min</em> denotes the minimum SDK (the latter is not available in old devices). It is best practice to use apps with maximum SDK that the platform currently supports. SDK is also known as <strong>API Level</strong>.

If you disable an app, the app will not be displayed in your Launcher app. Shortcuts for the app will also be removed. If you disable an user app, you can only enable them via App Manager or any other tool that supports it.

However, this is not always true.</li> <li><strong>Clear Data.</strong> Clear data from an app. This includes any information stored in the internal and often the external directories, including accounts (if set by the app), cache, etc. Clearing data from App Manager, for example, removes all the rules (the blocking is not removed though) saved within the app. Which is why you should always take backups of your rules. This button is not displayed to users who do not have root or <a href="/AppManager/guide/adb-over-tcp.html">ADB</a>.</li> <li><strong>Clear Cache.</strong> Clear app cache only. There is not any Android-way to clear app cache. Therefore, it needs root permission to clear cache from the app's internal storage.</li> <li><strong>Install.</strong> Install an apk opened using any third-party app. This button is only displayed for an external apk that hasn't been installed.</li> <li><strong>What's New.</strong> This button is displayed for an apk that has higher version code than the installed one. Clicking on this button displays a dialog consisting of differences in a version control manner. The information it displays include <em>version</em>, <em>trackers</em>, <em>permissions</em>, <em>components</em>, <em>signatures</em> (checksum changes), <em>features</em>, <em>shared libraries</em> and <em>sdk</em>.</li> <li><strong>Update.</strong> Displayed for an apk that has the higher version code than the installed one.</li> <li><strong>Manifest.</strong> Clicking on this button displays the app's manifest file in a separate page.

This is because they share similar features in many ways. For example, they all have a <em>name</em> and a <em>label</em>. Application components are the building blocks of any application, and most of these have to declared in the application manifest. Application manifest is a file where application specific metadata are stored. The Android operating system learns what to do with an app by reading the metadata. <a href="#color-codes">Colors</a> used in these tabs are explained above.</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Table of Contents</summary> <ul><li><a href="#activities">Activities</a></li> <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li> <li><a href="#receivers">Receivers</a></li> <li><a href="#providers">Providers</a></li> <li><a href="#additional-features-for-rooted-phones">Additional Features for Rooted Phones</a></li></ul></details> <h3 id="activities"><a href="#activities" class="header-anchor">#</a> Activities</h3> <p><strong>Activities</strong> are windows or pages that you can browse (for instance <em>Main page</em> and <em>App Details page</em> are two separate activities). In other words, an activity is a user interface (UI) component. Each activity can have multiple UI components known as <em>widgets</em> or <em>fragments</em>, and similarly, each of these latter components can have multiple of them nested or on top of each other. But an activity is a <em>master</em> component: There cannot be two nested activities. An application author can also choose to open external files within an activity using a method called <em>intent filters</em>. When you try to open a file using your file manager, either your file manager or system scans for intent filters to decide which activities can open that particular file and offers you to open the file with these activities (therefore, it is nothing to do with the application itself). There are other intent filters as well.</p> <p>Activities which are <em>exportable</em> can usually be opened by any third-party apps (some activities require permissions, if that is the case, only an app having those permissions can open them). In the <em>Activities</em> tab, the name of the activity (on top of each list item) is actually a button. It is enabled for the <em>exportable</em> activities and disabled for others. You can use this to open the activity directly using App Manager.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">Notice</p> <p>If you are not able to open any activity, chances are it has certain dependencies which are not met, e.g., you cannot open  <em>App Details Activity</em> because it requires that you at least supply a package name. These dependencies cannot always be inferred programmatically. Therefore, you cannot open them using App Manager.</p></div> <p>You can also create shortcut for these <em>exportable</em> activites (using the dedicated button), and if you want, you can edit the shortcut as well using the <em>Edit Shortcut</em> button.</p> <div class="custom-block danger"><p class="custom-block-title">Caution</p> <p>If you uninstall App Manager, the shortcuts created by App Manager will be lost.</p></div> <h3 id="services"><a href="#services" class="header-anchor">#</a> Services</h3> <p>Unlike <a href="#activities">activities</a> which users can see, <strong>Services</strong> handle background tasks. If you're, for example, downloading a video from the internet using your phone's Internet browser, the Internet browser is using a background service to download the content.</p> <p>When you close an activity, it usually gets destroyed immediately (depending on many factors such as how much free memory your phone has). But services can be run for indefinite periods if desired. If more services are running in background, you phone will get slower due to shortage of memory and/or processing power, and your phone's battery can be drained more quickly. Newer Android versions have a battery optimization feature enabled by default for all apps. With this feature enabled, the system can randomly terminate any service.</p> <p>By the way, both activities and services are run in the same looper called the main <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7597742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looper<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, which means the services are not really run in the background. It's the application authors job to ensure that. How do application communicate with services? They use <a href="#receivers">broadcast receivers</a>.</p> <h3 id="receivers"><a href="#receivers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Receivers</h3> <p><strong>Receivers</strong> (also called <em>broadcast receivers</em>) can be used to trigger execution of certain tasks for certain events. These components are called broadcast receivers because they are executed as soon as a broadcast message is received. These broadcast messages are sent using a method called intent. Intent is a special feature for Android which can be used to open applications, activities, services and send broadcast messages. Therefore, like <a href="#activities">activities</a>, broadcast receivers use intent filters to receive only the desired broadcast message(s). Broadcast messages can be sent by either system or the app itself. When a broadcast message is sent, the corresponding receivers are awaken by the system so that they can execute tasks. For example, if you have low memory, your phone may freeze or experience lags for a moment after you enable mobile data or connect to the Wifi. Ever wondered why? This is because broadcast receivers that can receive <code>android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE</code> are awaken by the system as soon as you enable data connection. Since many apps use this intent filter, all of these apps are awaken almost immediately by the system which causes the freeze or lags. That being said, receivers can be used for inter-process communication (IPC), i.e., it helps you communicate between different apps (provided you have the necessary permissions) or even different components of a single app.</p> <h3 id="providers"><a href="#providers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Providers</h3> <p><strong>Providers</strong> (also called <em>content providers</em>) are used for data management. For example, when you save an apk file or export rules in App Manager, it uses a content provider called <code>androidx.core.content.FileProvider</code> to save the apk or export the rules. There are other content providers or even custom ones to manage various content-related tasks such as database management, tracking, searching, etc. Each content provider has a field called <em>Authority</em> which is unique to that particular app in the entire Android eco-system just like the package name.</p> <h3 id="additional-features-for-rooted-phones"><a href="#additional-features-for-rooted-phones" class="header-anchor">#</a> Additional Features for Rooted Phones</h3> <p>Unlike non-root users who are just spectators in these tabs, root users can perform various operations. On the right-most side of each component item, there is a âblockâ icon (which becomes a âunblock/restoreâ icon when the component is being blocked). This icon can be used to toggle blocking status of that particular component. If you do not have <a href="/AppManager/guide/settings.html#global-component-blocking">Global Component Blocking</a> enabled or haven't applied blocking for the app before, you have to apply the changes using the <strong>Apply rules</strong> option in the top-right menu. You can also remove already applied rules using the same option (which would be read as <strong>Remove rules</strong> this time). You also have the ability to sort the component list to display blocked or tracker components on top of the list using the <strong>Sort</strong> option in the same menu. You can also disable all ad and tracker components using the <strong>Block tracker</strong> option in the menu.</p> <p><em>See also:</em></p> <ul><li><em><a href="/AppManager/guide/exodus-page.html">Îµxodus Page</a></em></li> <li><em><a href="/AppManager/faq/app-components.html">FAQ: App Components</a></em></li></ul> <h2 id="permission-tabs"><a href="#permission-tabs" class="header-anchor">#</a> Permission Tabs</h2> <p><strong>App Ops</strong>, <strong>Uses Permissions</strong> and <strong>Permissions</strong> tabs are related to permissions. In Android communication between apps or processes which do not have the same identity (known as <em>shared id</em>) often require permission(s). These permissions are managed by the permission controller. Some permissions are considered <em>normal</em> permissions which are granted automatically if they appear in the application manifest, but <em>dangerous</em> and <em>development</em> permissions require confirmation from the user. <a href="#color-codes">Colors</a> used in these tabs are explained above.</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Table of Contents</summary> <ul><li><a href="#app-ops">App Ops</a></li> <li><a href="#uses-permissions">Uses Permissions</a></li> <li><a href="#permissions">Permissions</a></li></ul></details> <h3 id="app-ops"><a href="#app-ops" class="header-anchor">#</a> App Ops</h3> <p><strong>App Ops</strong> stands for <strong>Application Operations</strong>. Since Android 4.3, <em>App Ops</em> are used by Android system to control most of the application permissions. Each app op has a unique number associated with them which are closed inside first brackets in the App Ops tab. They also have private and optionally a public name. Some app ops are associated with <em>permissions</em> as well. The dangerousness of an app op is decided based on the associated permission, and other informations such as <em>flags</em>, <em>permission name</em>, <em>permission description</em>, <em>package name</em>, <em>group</em> are taken from the associated <a href="#permissions">permission</a>. Other information may include the following:</p> <ul><li><strong>Mode.</strong> It describes the current authorization status which can be <em>allow</em>, <em>deny</em> (a rather misonomer, it simply means error), <em>ignore</em> (it actually means deny), <em>default</em> (inferred from a list of defaults set internally by the vendor), <em>foreground</em> (in newer Androids, it means the app op can only be used when the app is running in foreground), and some custom modes set by the vendors (MIUI uses <em>ask</em> and other modes with just numbers without any associated names).</li> <li><strong>Duration.</strong> The amount of time this app op has been used (there can be negative durations whose use cases are currently not known to me).</li> <li><strong>Accept Time.</strong> The last time the app op was accepted.</li> <li><strong>Reject Time.</strong> The last time the app op was rejected.</li></ul> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Info</p> <p>Contents of this tab are only visible to the root and <a href="/AppManager/guide/adb-over-tcp.html">ADB</a> users.</p></div> <p>There is a toggle button next to each app op item which can be used to allow or deny (ignore) the app op. You can also reset your changes using the <em>Reset to default</em> option or deny all dangerous app ops using the corresponding option in the menu. You can also sort them in ascending order by app op names and the associated unique numbers (or values). You can also list the denied app ops first using the corresponding sorting option.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>Denying an app op may cause the app to misbehave.

This is named so because they are declared in the manifest using <code>uses-permission</code> tags. Informations such as <em>flags</em>, <em>permission name</em>, <em>permission description</em>, <em>package name</em>, <em>group</em> are taken from the associated <a href="#permissions">permission</a>.</p> <p><strong>Root and <a href="/AppManager/guide/adb-over-tcp.html">ADB</a> users</strong> can grant or revoke the <em>dangerous</em> and <em>development</em> permissions using the toggle button on the right side of each permission item. They can also revoke dangerous permissions all at once using the corresponding option in the menu. Only these two types of permissions can be revoked because Android doesn't allow modifiying <em>normal</em> permissions (which most of them are). The only alternative is to edit the app manifest and remove these permissions from there.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Info</p> <p>Since dangerous permissions are revoked by default by the system, revoking all dangerous permissions is the same as resetting all permissions.</p></div> <p>Users can sort the permissions by permission name (in ascending order) or choose to display denied or dangerous permissions at first using the corresponding options in the menu.</p> <h3 id="permissions"><a href="#permissions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Permissions</h3> <p><strong>Permissions</strong> are usually custom permissions defined by the app itself. It could contain regular permissions as well, mostly in old applications. Here's a complete description of each item that is displayed there:</p> <ul><li><strong>Name.</strong> Each permission has a unique name like <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> but multiple app can request the permission.</li> <li><strong>Icon.</strong> Each permission can have a custom icon. The other permission tabs do not have any icon because they do not contain any icon in the app manifest.</li> <li><strong>Description.</strong> This optional field describes the permission. If there isn't any description associated with the permission, the field is not displayed.</li> <li><strong>Flags.</strong> (Uses â symbol or <strong>Protection Level</strong> name) This describes various permission flags such as <em>normal</em>, <em>development</em>, <em>dangerous</em>, <em>instant</em>, <em>granted</em>, <em>revoked</em>, <em>signature</em>, <em>privileged</em>, etc.</li> <li><strong>Package Name.</strong> Denotes the package name associated with the permission, i.e., the package that defined the permission.</li> <li><strong>Group.</strong> The group name associated with the permission (if any). Newer Androids do not seem to use group names which is why you'll usually see <code>android.permission-group.UNDEFINED</code> or no group name at all.</li></ul> <h2 id="signatures-tab"><a href="#signatures-tab" class="header-anchor">#</a> Signatures Tab</h2> <p><strong>Signatures</strong> are actually called signing info. An application is signed by one or more singing certificates by the application developers before publishing it. The integrity of an application (whether the app is from the actual developer and isn't modified by other people) can be checked using the signing info; because when an app is modified by a third-party unauthorized person, the app cannot be signed using the original certificate(s) again because the signing info are kept private by the actual developer. <em>How do you verify these signatures?</em> Using checksums. Checksums are generated from the certificates themselves. If the developer supplies the checksums, you can match the checksums using the different checksums generated in the <strong>Signatures</strong> tab. For example, if you have downloaded App Manager from Github, Telegram Channel or IzzyOnDroid's repo, you can verify whether the app is actually released by me by simply matching the following <em>sha256</em> checksum with the one displayed in this tab:</p> <div class="language- line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>320c0c0fe8cef873f2b554cb88c837f1512589dcced50c5b25c43c04596760ab
