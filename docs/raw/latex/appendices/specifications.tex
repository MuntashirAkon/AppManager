\section{Rules Specification}\label{sec:rules-specification} %%##appendices_specifications-rules-specification==title>>
\subsection{Background} %%##appendices_specifications-background==title>>
%%!!appendices_specifications-background<<
AM currently supports blocking activities, broadcast receivers, content providers, services, app ops and permissions,
and in future I may add more blocking options. In order to add more portability, it is necessary to import/export all
these data.

Maintaining a database should be the best choice when it comes to storing data. For now, several \texttt{tsv} files
with each file having the name of the package and a \texttt{.tsv} extension. The file/database will be queried/processed
by the \texttt{RulesStorageManager} class. Due to this abstraction, it should be easier to switch to database or
encrypted database systems in future without changing the design of the entire project. Currently, All configuration
files are stored at \texttt{/data/data/io.github.muntashirakon.AppManager/Files/conf}.

\subsection{Rules File Format} %%##appendices_specifications-rulesfileformat==title>>

\subsubsection{Internal} %%##appendices_specifications-internal==title>>
%%!!appendices_specifications-internal<<
The format below is used internally within App Manager and is \textit{not compatible with the external format.}
\begin{Verbatim}
    <name> <type> <mode>|<component_status>|<is_granted>
\end{Verbatim}
Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{<name>} -- Component/permission/app op name (in case of app op, it could be string or integer)
    \item \texttt{<type>} -- One of the \texttt{ACTIVITY}, \texttt{RECEIVER}, \texttt{PROVIDER}, \texttt{SERVICE},
    \texttt{APP\_OP},  \texttt{PERMISSION}
    \item \texttt{<mode>} -- (For app ops) The associated \hyperref[subsec:mode-constants]{mode constant}
    \item \texttt{<component\_status>} -- (For components) Component status
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{true} -- Component has been applied (\texttt{true} value is kept for compatibility)
        \item \texttt{false} -- Component hasn't been applied yet, but will be applied in future (\texttt{false} value
        is kept for compatibility)
        \item \texttt{unblocked} -- Component is scheduled to be unblocked
    \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{<is\_granted>} -- (For permissions) Whether the permission is granted or revoked
\end{itemize}
%%!!>>

\subsubsection{External} %%##appendices_specifications-external==title>>
%%!!appendices_specifications-external<<
External format is used for importing or exporting rules in App Manager.
\begin{Verbatim}
    <package_name> <component_name> <type> <mode>|<component_status>|<is_granted>
\end{Verbatim}
This the format is essentially the same as above except for the first item which is the name of the package.

\begin{danger}{Caution}
    The exported rules have a different format than the internal one and should not be copied directly to the
    \textbf{conf} folder.
\end{danger}
