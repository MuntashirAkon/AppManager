## Instruction

`./doctool.sh updatetranslation`
This command will extract strings from TeX and create strings.xml.
Copy it with identificatable name and translate it.
Please note that line breaks are ignored.
And Please don't break TeX tags(eg,\hyperref[],\textbf,\cref)

`./doctool.sh mergetranslation`
Then,this command will update TeX from strings.xml.
If strings.xml syntax is invaild,you will get error when you run this command.
It takes several times.

`./doctool.sh buildhtml`
Finally this command will build html file.
Please check output file to check if your translation applied correctly

## How to add new article to base docs and make it translatable

#### 1.Add article by following latex syntax


#### 2.Add string keys for titles

Title means strings written in `section{},subsection{},subsubsection{},chapter{},caption{},paragraph{}` tex tags.

Add string keys like %%##string_key==title>> at the end of title line.

For example,

If you added line `\chapter{App Ops}\label{ch:app-ops}`,change it to like `\chapter{App Ops}\label{ch:app-ops} %%##appendices_appops-chapter==title>>`.

This will extracted as `<string name="appendices_appops-chapter==title">App Ops</string>` to Xliff.

Make sure that title string key names must be finished by `==title`, otherwise you will get bugs when merging translation.

#### 3.Add string keys for content

If you added lines like bellow:

```
After \hyperref[subsubsec:location-of-developer-options]{locating the developer options}, enable \textbf{Developer
option} (if not already). After that, scroll down a bit until you will find the option \textbf{USB debugging}. Use the
toggle button on the right hand side to enable it. At this point, you may get an alert prompt where you may have to
click \textit{OK} to actually enable it. You may also have to enable some other options depending on device vendor and
ROM. Here are some examples:
```

Change it like this:

```
%%!!guide_aot-enableusbdbg<<
After \hyperref[subsubsec:location-of-developer-options]{locating the developer options}, enable \textbf{Developer
option} (if not already). After that, scroll down a bit until you will find the option \textbf{USB debugging}. Use the
toggle button on the right hand side to enable it. At this point, you may get an alert prompt where you may have to
click \textit{OK} to actually enable it. You may also have to enable some other options depending on device vendor and
ROM. Here are some examples:
%%!!>>
```

This will allow extracting enclosed strings within `%%!!string_key<<` and `%%!!>>`
You can use any identificator for content stringkey,but you should follow the form to unify style.
