%%!!intro<<
App Manager is an advanced package manager for Android. It offers countless features, and consequently, requires a user
manual to assist its users. This document acts as a user manual for App Manager in the sense that it aims to describe
every feature that App Manager has to offer. This document can also be considered as the ``official'' guidelines for
App Manager, and represents the expected behaviour of App Manager. Translations can misinterpret this document (which is
written in English). Therefore, every capable user should read the English version of the document to get the best out
of App Manager. There might as well be other unofficial or third-party resources such as blog articles, videos, chat
groups, etc. While these resources might be useful for many people, they might not be up-to-date with the current
version of App Manager. If any deviations are detected in App Manager from this document, they should be reported in the
\href{https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager/issues}{App Manager issue tracker}.

\section{Terminologies}\label{sec:terminologies} %%##$terminologies-title>>
%%!!terminologies<<
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AM} --- Short name for App Manager.
    \item \textbf{Block/Unblock} --- Used for component blocking or unblocking. How components are blocked depends on
    the user preferences.
    \item \textbf{IFW} --- Short form of Intent Firewall.
    \item \textbf{Ops} --- Short name for operations, e.g.\ app ops, batch ops, 1-click ops
    \item \textbf{SAF} --- Short for Storage Access Framework, an abstraction used by Android to allow apps to use or
    serve files without worrying about the underlying file system.
    \item \textbf{SSAID} --- Short form of \texttt{Settings.Secure.ANDROID\_ID}. It is a device identifier assigned to
    each app (Android Oreo and onwards). It is generated from the combination of the signing certificate of the app
    and the SSAID set for the package \texttt{android}. As a result, it is guaranteed to be the same for an app unless
    the user choose to format the device. It is widely used for tracking.
    \item \textbf{Tracker} --- Denotes tracker components throughout the document and in App Manager except in the
    \hyperref[sec:scanner-page]{scanner page}. Trackers include libraries such as crash reporters, analytics,
    profiling, identification, ad, location, etc. Thus, they are not equal in functions. There is no distinction or bias
    between open source and closed source libraries that promote tracking.

Repositories located in sites other than GitHub are currently considered mirrors, and pull/merge requests submitted in
those sites will not be accepted.\footnote{GitHub pull requests will be merged manually using the corresponding patches.

be submitted via email attachments. \textit{Signing-off is a requirement.} See the CONTRIBUTING file located at the root
directory of the source for more information.
