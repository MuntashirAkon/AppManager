            When the mode of operation is set to auto, App Manager will attempt to find the best mode and set it as the

            service via upcoming App Manager SDK.

        <fix>Fixed writing to files that were managed by ContentProvider</fix>

        <title type="medium">Explorer</title>
        <improve>Avoided decoding AXML files</improve>
        <note subtext="true">Decoding should be done by code editors, not explorers.</note>

        <title type="medium">Files</title>
        <new>Added a floating action button to create new files, folders and links</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            It allows creating a few blank documents. They include: text files, PDF, documents (docx/odt), sheet
            (xlsx/ods), presentation (pptx, odp) and SQLite3 database.
        </note>
        <new>Added intent-filters that allows opening folders from third-party apps</new>
        <new>Display path navigation on top</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Using the path navigation, it is possible to navigate to any parent folders quite easily, or navigate to any
            arbitrary location using the “Edit” or “Go to” button.[br /]

            Long clicking on any path also displays a popup menu which can be used to copy the path, open it in a new
            window or view properties.
        </note>
        <new>Display thumbnails for supported files</new>
        <new>Implemented all the unimplemented features in popup menus</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Implemented copy- and cut-paste options, shortcut creation, multiple selection options such as batch
            renaming, deletion, cut/copying and sharing. Note that [u]copy and paste options are experimental and should
            be handled with care.[/u]
        </note>
        <new>Implemented settings for file manager</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Added option to set home directory, remember last opened folder and position, and whether to display the
            file manager as “Files” in the app drawer like a regular app.
        </note>
        <improve>Added searching in the “Open with” dialog</improve>
        <improve>Added support for SAF/tree URIs</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            SAF access is currently very slow and its usage isn't recommended if there are a lot of files in the folder.
        </note>
        <improve>Display folder info (size, file count, etc.) as a subtitle</improve>
        <improve>Display helpful messages when a folder is empty, non-existent or invalid</improve>
        <improve>
            Implemented modification of access and modification dates, permissions, UID/GID and SELinux context in the
            properties dialog
        </improve>
        <improve>Open resolved symbolic link instead of the link itself</improve>
        <improve>Remember the selection locations for past opened folders in a session</improve>
        <improve>Use file overlays to display directories inaccessible in no-root mode</improve>

        <title type="medium">Installer</title>
        <new>Added an option to perform DEX optimisation immediately after installing an app</new>
        <new>Added the ability to modify installer options before installing an app</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            In the installation dialog, clicking on the settings/cog icon opens a new dialog where the installer
            options can be temporarily set for the session. Any items queued for the session will retain those temporary
            options.
        </note>
        <improve>Display installation progress in the notification</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            In some devices such as Samsung, it takes an indefinite amount of time to verify the app after copying the
            APK files. For those cases, the progress won't be accurate as it only takes into account the amount of time
            to copy the files.
        </note>
        <improve>Display “Confirm install” notification even if the app is running in foreground</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            In no-root mode, when the app is running in foreground, the user may accidentally dismiss the
            install-confirmation dialog produced by the Android package installer which would either allow the
            installation to run forever or for a minute until the timeout occurs. To solve the issue, a silent
            notification is triggered at the same time the dialog is shown so that even if the user accidentally
            dismisses the dialog, the dialog can still be displayed by clicking the notification.
        </note>
        <fix>Fixed parsing unsigned APK files</fix>
        <fix>Fixed installing apps for users other than the main profile</fix>

        <title type="medium">Interceptor</title>
        <fix>Prevented the app from crashing on creating a shortcut with invalid extras</fix>
        <note subtext="true">
            Shortcuts support only 11 types of data structures. Intents, on the other hand, support any type of data
            structures. When a shortcut creation is requested, the unsupported data structures are removed from the
            Intent to avoid crashes.
        </note>

        <title type="medium">Labs</title>
        <improve>Display “System Config” page in all modes of operation</improve>

        <title type="medium">Main page</title>
        <new>Added a new filtering option “Stopped apps“ to filter the force-stopped apps</new>
        <new>Added filtering by users in the list options</new>
        <new>Added a new batch operation “Optimise” to dex optimisation of the selected apps</new>
        <improve>Display user count alongside app ID</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            If an app is installed in more than one profiles (that is, for multiple users), instead of displaying only
            the kernel user ID (UID), display the app ID (that is, UID sans the user ID) and user count in the following
            format:[br /]

            [tt]&amp;lt;user count&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;app ID&amp;gt;[/tt]
        </note>

        <title type="medium">Scanner</title>
        <new>Display link to Pithus report if available</new>
        <improve>Calculate file hashes more efficiently</improve>
        <fix>Fixed scanning external APK files in privileged mode</fix>

        <title type="medium">Settings</title>
        <new>Added options to run App Manager in the background</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            In Settings > Privacy, two new options have been added:[br /]
            1. Run App Manager in the background[br /]
            2. Automatic lockdown[br /]
            [br /]

            Running App Manager in the background makes the annoying “Initializing” screen go away. Due to possible
            privacy issues, this option is disabled by default. When automatic lockdown is enabled, App Manager will
            attempt to lock the app by killing its process. As expected, there are several side effects:[br /]
            1. All the activities will be closed. They'll be reopened by the system based on how the user was
            interacting with them[br /]
            2. All the running operations as well as scheduled or running jobs will be stopped immediately. This might
            cause data loss if potentially destructive operations are running.[br /]
            [br /]

            Note: Enabling the latter option does not wipe the memory of App Manager, i.e. it does not prevent a
            forensic software from scrapping the memory used by App Manager even if the process no longer exists.
        </note>
        <new>Added option to disable sending notification to the connected devices</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            The setting is located at [a href="app-manager://settings/advanced_prefs"]Settings > Advanced > Send
            notifications to the connected devices[/a] and is enabled by default. Low importance notifications, e.g.
            ongoing notifications and optional alerts, won't be delivered to the connected devices even if the setting
            is enabled.
        </note>
        <fix>Fixed saving backup options</fix>
        <fix>Prevented a crash that occurs on importing the rules if some of them are invalid</fix>

        <title type="medium">UI</title>
        <improve>
            Better handling of application-wide notifications including the progress of various operations
        </improve>
        <improve>Display all multi-selection options in a single row with an overflow menu at the end</improve>
        <improve>Display icons in popup menus</improve>
        <improve>Display shortcut editor before creating a shortcut along with a preview panel</improve>
        <improve>Improved layouts of popup and dropdown menus</improve>

        <title type="medium">Usage</title>
        <improve>Fetch data usage for all apps in Android 5 and 5.1</improve>
        <improve>Fetch usage stats and package size info only when the feature is enabled</improve>
        <improve>Reduced lags by recycling views</improve>

        <title type="medium">Others</title>
        <new>New mode of operation: System (UID 100)</new>
        <improve>Enabled backing up data from App Manager via Android-default backup systems</improve>
        <improve>Improved DEX optimiser</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            DEX optimiser now works in no-root mode for apps installed with App Manager. In 1-Click Ops page, when
            DEX optimiser is run, it attempts to optimise all apps in privileged mode. But in unprivileged mode, it only
            attempts to optimise apps installed by App Manager. The option is also displayed in the App Info tab in
            no-root mode for apps installed by App Manager.
        </note>
        <improve>Only allow connections from supported online locations</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            To avoid issues with ADB, localhost is allowed unrestricted connections, but other websites, namely
            virustotal.com and pithus.org, are restricted via public key pinning (PKP) using network security
            configuration.
        </note>
        <improve>Replaced the usernames “Main” and “Work” with “This” and “Other”</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            In no-root mode, usernames cannot be fetched from the system. Hence, “Main” and “Work” are inferred based on
            the status of the system. However, this can cause issues if the app is installed in the Work profile.
            Instead, the names “This” and “Other” are used to clarify the situation.
        </note>
        <improve>
            Schedule cache cleaning job more actively to ensure App Manager's caches are cleared regularly
        </improve>
        <improve>
            Use granted permissions rather than the mode of operation to check the eligibility of a feature
        </improve>
        <fix>Prevented crashing in Android 14 due to compatibility issues related to installer</fix>
        <fix>Prevented crashing in various places due to lifecycle issues</fix>

            Debloating profiles were available as “Presets” in the Profiles page which has now been replaced with the
            Debloater page which can be accessed from the three-dots menu in the Main page.[br /][br /]

            The list is taken from [a href="https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater"]UAD project[/a] and
            kept intact for now.[br /][br /]

            Colour codes for the list:[br /]
            - Dark cyan: The app is safe to remove. It does not necessarily mean that the app should be removed as it is
            always up to the preferences of the user[br /]
            - Sand colour: The app is safe to remove, but removing it might break one or more features[br /]
            - Orange: The app may or may not be safe to remove[br /]
            - Red: The app is not safe to remove. It is not clear as to why these apps are listed in the UAD list.[br /]
            [br /]

            Batch operations:[br /]
            - Uninstallation[br /]
            - Enable/disable[br /]
            - Save APK[br /]
            - Create new profile[br /]
            - Add to profile.[br /][br /]

            In addition to the typical search option, there are several filtering options available in this page:[br /]
            1. Categories: AOSP, OEM, Carrier/ISP, Google, Miscellany and Pending[br /]
            2. Types: Safe (i.e. safe to remove), Replace (i.e. should be replaced with alternatives), Caution (i.e.
            generally safe to remove but no guarantees), Unsafe (may cause bootloop)[br /]
            3. Other: User apps, System apps (mutually exclusive), Installed apps and Uninstalled apps (mutually
            exclusive).

        <note subtext="true">
            “Open links” is displayed for apps capable of opening links from the verified domains without any user
            intervention. This feature, added in Android 12, has raised privacy as well as usability concerns, because
            it promotes tracking and reduce user's freedom of choice. Therefore, in active state, that is, when the app
            is able to open the links directly, this tag will have a “red” background (otherwise, it will have a “green”
            background).[br /][br /]

            On clicking the tag, a list of supported domains will be displayed in a dialog (although not all domains can
            be opened by default). If the user has enough permissions, an option to enable/disable the behaviour will be
            displayed. Otherwise, an option to open the app details page in the Android Settings app will be displayed.

            When APK signing is enabled, enabling this option will ensure that the contents of the APK are aligned

            by default.

        <note subtext="true">
            To ensure the safety of the users, App Manager is set to expire several months after it is published. A
            warning shall be issued for a certain period before the expiry date. After that, App Manager shall
            completely stop responding to any requests and prompt user to update or uninstall the application. However,
            for stable releases, it will still be possible to use the application but the warning shall be displayed
            every time the application is launched.

        <improve title="Security">Removed default signing key</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Default signing key was publicly available and could have be used by others to distribute malware. Instead,
            enabling APK signing before installing an app now requires a signing key to be added (which can be either
            generated or imported).
        </note>

        <improve>Check whether Binder transaction is supported in root mode before initiating a connection</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Certain superuser implementations did not enable communications through Binder (that, is binder
            transactions) from user applications. A check has been added to ensure that the currently used superuser
            supports such communications before attempting to create a remote service.
        </note>
        <improve>Fall back to ADB if root mode is not supported</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            If App Manager cannot connect using root, root itself is used to start ADB over TCP and connect to it. This
            is also useful for certain rooting solutions which do not support Binder transactions.

        <improve>Handle multiple users including work profile in no-root mode</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Apps in the work profile can be opened in the App Details page. They can also be launched, uninstalled, and
            the corresponding settings page can also be opened in no-root mode.

        <improve>Ensured forward-compatibility in app ops</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            App Manager now handles vendor-specific app ops, newly added app ops in the AOSP, etc. automatically to
            prevent random crashes.

        <improve>Improved Java to Smali conversion mechanism</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Now all the Smali files related to the current file (inner classes, for example) are also converted into
            Java to make it easier to understand the code.

        <improve>Handle incomplete USB debugging</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            On certain devices, enabling USB debugging may not be enough to use ADB. In such cases, App Manager will
            report incomplete USB debugging along with a potential way to solve the issue.
        </note>
        <improve>Ensure the existence of shared cache directory before launching App Manager</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Shared cache directory must exist in all Android devices. If it does not, the ROM is likely broken.
        </note>
        <improve>Fall back to root mode while reading the APK file</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Some applications erroneously provide private files that aren't accessible to any installer other than the
            system ones. Therefore, root mode is used to read those files if available.

            To improve speed, databases are often stored in multiple files. Therefore, simply opening the main database
