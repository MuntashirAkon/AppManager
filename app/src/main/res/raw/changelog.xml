        <new>Added full support for Android 14</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            - Fixed compatibility issues[br /]
            - Support installing apps that targets SDK 22 or earlier (privileged mode only)

        <improve title="Experimental">Use outlines for color codes</improve>

        <title type="medium">App Details page</title>
        <new>Allowed launching non-exported activities in no-root/ADB mode</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            The “Search assistant” (usually set to Google Assistant) feature allows setting
            arbitrary activity via the [tt]assistant[/tt] key-value pair stored in the secure
            settings database. Hence, non-exported (that is, app private) activities can be launched
            even in no-root mode by exploiting this feature. However, modifying a secure setting
            require [tt]android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS[/tt] permission which is granted
            automatically in ADB mode and has to be granted manually in no-root mode via ADB.[br /]

            App Manager also cannot trigger the assistant on its own in the no-root mode, because it
            doesn't have enough permissions (it requires [tt]android.permission.INEJECT_EVENTS[/tt]
            permission which cannot be granted to the user applications). Activity shortcuts also
            use this feature when they cannot be launched in privileged mode.

        <fix>Make the combo-box static on top</fix>

        <fix>Prevent crashes in tablets running buggy GSI firmware</fix>

        <title type="medium">Code Editor</title>
        <fix>Prevented the editor from crashing if it is restarted from Recents</fix>

        <title type="medium">Installer</title>
        <improve>Enabled installing system apps with a different signature</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            The “Install only” button is enabled for system apps when the signatures are different.
            This is useful for only those who have disabled signature verification using methods,
            such as CorePatch.

        <new>Added a batch option to copy the selected logs</new>

            are enabled automatically before attempting any connections. This requires:[br /]
            1. [tt]android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS[/tt] to be granted to App Manager, OR[br /]
            2. App Manager connected via root or ADB at least once (in which case, the permission
            above is granted automatically)[br /]
            - Attempt to fetch the current port for ADB over TCP via [tt]service.adb.tcp.port[/tt]

        <fix>Fixed blocking providers when only IFW is set</fix>
        <note subtext="true">
            Intent Firewall (IFW) does not support blocking providers. So, when IFW-only mode was
            enabled, it tried to apply only the IFW rules which resulted in the providers remaining
            unblocked. From now on, the providers are blocked via “disable” option.

            In some devices such as Samsung, it takes an indefinite amount of time to verify the app after copying the

        <note subtext="true">
            In no-root mode, when the app is running in foreground, the user may accidentally dismiss the
            install-confirmation dialog produced by the Android package installer which would either allow the
            installation to run forever or for a minute until the timeout occurs. To solve the issue, a silent
            notification is triggered at the same time the dialog is shown so that even if the user accidentally
            dismisses the dialog, the dialog can still be displayed by clicking the notification.

            In Settings > Privacy, two new options have been added:[br /]
            1. Run App Manager in the background[br /]
            2. Automatic lockdown[br /]
            [br /]

            Running App Manager in the background makes the annoying “Initializing” screen go away. Due to possible
            privacy issues, this option is disabled by default. When automatic lockdown is enabled, App Manager will
            attempt to lock the app by killing its process. As expected, there are several side effects:[br /]
            1. All the activities will be closed. They'll be reopened by the system based on how the user was
            interacting with them[br /]
            2. All the running operations as well as scheduled or running jobs will be stopped immediately. This might
            cause data loss if potentially destructive operations are running.[br /]
            [br /]

            Note: Enabling the latter option does not wipe the memory of App Manager, i.e. it does not prevent a
            forensic software from scrapping the memory used by App Manager even if the process no longer exists.

            always up to the preferences of the user[br /]
            - Sand colour: The app is safe to remove, but removing it might break one or more features[br /]
            - Orange: The app may or may not be safe to remove[br /]
            - Red: The app is not safe to remove. It is not clear as to why these apps are listed in the UAD list.[br /]

            In addition to the typical search option, there are several filtering options available in this page:[br /]
            1. Categories: AOSP, OEM, Carrier/ISP, Google, Miscellany and Pending[br /]
            2. Types: Safe (i.e. safe to remove), Replace (i.e. should be replaced with alternatives), Caution (i.e.

            it promotes tracking and reduce user's freedom of choice. Therefore, in active state, that is, when the app
            is able to open the links directly, this tag will have a “red” background (otherwise, it will have a “green”
            background).[br /][br /]
