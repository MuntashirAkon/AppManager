            The uri is similar to [tt]market://details?id=&lt;pkg>[/tt] in addition to supporting an
            optional user ID as a query parameter. If user ID is provided but does not exist in
            system, it does not fall back to the default user ID to avoid inconsistent behavior.

        <improve>Offer to unfreeze temporarily when launching activity shortcuts</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            If the app corresponding to the shortcut being launched is frozen, offer user to
            unfreeze the app temporarily so that the shortcut can be launched. The app will be
            frozen again once the screen is locked. However, this may not work on devices without
            a screen lock or if the screen is locked some time after the display goes off (possibly
            due to power management issues).

            If a remote server is running in the background but the mode of operations in App
            Manager is set to "no-root", it will directly launch in no-root mode instead of waiting
            for a response from the remote server.

        <improve>Improve query highlighting</improve>
        <note subtext="true">
            Instead of red, which is used in the texts, a variant of yellow (canary) is used for
            highlighting texts in the light mode and a variant of brown (domino) is used for
            highlighting texts in the dark mode.

        <new>New logo for App Manager!</new>
        <new>A dedicated page for debloating the phone</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Debloating profiles were available as “Presets” in the Profiles page which has now been
            replaced with the Debloater page which can be accessed from the three-dots menu in the
            Main page. [a href="https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/android-debloat-list"]ADL[/a] is a
            new project focused on maintaining a list of bloatware as well as potential open source
            alternatives.[br /][br /]

            Color codes for the list:[br /]
            - Dark cyan: The app is safe to remove. It does not necessarily mean that the app should
            be removed as it is always up to the user[br /]
            - Sand color: The app is safe to remove, but removing it might break one or more
            features[br /]
            - Orange: The app may or may not be safe to remove[br /]
            - Red: The app is not safe to remove.[br /]
            [br /]

            Batch operations:[br /]
            - Uninstallation[br /]
            - Enable/disable[br /]
            - Save APK[br /]
            - Create new profile[br /]
            - Add to profile.[br /]
            [br /]

            On clicking an item, the following information are displayed with:[br /]
            - App icon (valid only when the app is installed)[br /]
            - App label[br /]
            - Package name[br /]
            - App info button (if the app is installed)[br /]
            - Tags[br /]
            - Warning (if available)[br /]
            - Description with references[br /]
            - Dependencies[br /]
            - Suggestions/alternatives.[br /]
            [br /]

            In addition to the typical search option, there are several filtering options available
            in this page:[br /]
            1. Categories: AOSP, OEM, Carrier/ISP, Google, Miscellany, and Pending[br /]
            2. Types: Safe (i.e., safe to remove), Replace (i.e., should be replaced with
            alternatives), Caution (i.e., generally safe to remove but no guarantees), Unsafe (may
            cause bootloop)[br /]
            3. Other: User apps, System apps (mutually exclusive), Installed apps and Uninstalled
            apps (mutually exclusive).

        <new>Integrated code editor</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Manifest and code viewers have been replaced with this new editor. Among other regular
            features, it includes proper syntax highlighting and advanced searching options. In
            addition, files from third-party apps can also be opened for editing.

        <new>New widget: Data usage</new>
        <note subtext="true">Display total download and upload speed for today.</note>
        <new>Added options for runtime optimization in Android 7 or later</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            This option is available for all apps in the 1-click ops page and individual app in the
            three-dots menu in the app info tab.[br /][br /]

            Features:[br /]
            - Set Compile filters, such as speed-profile or everything-profile[br /]
            - Compile layout resources[br /]
            - Immediate optimization of DEX, i.e., somewhat similar to [tt]pm force-dex-opt[/tt]

        <new>Save install, batch and profile operations to history</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            Each history entry remembers everything necessary to allow it to be re-executed.
            However, any re-execution attempt may still fail for the following reasons:[br/]
            1. The history entry has certain apps requirements that are no longer installed[br/]
            2. The history entry may rely on external files that are no loner available or
            accessible to App Manager[br/]
            3. The privilege has changed (e.g., previously it was executed with root but now
            no-root)[br/]
            4. The operating system no longer supports the functions[br/]
            5. App Manager no longer allows the operation.[br/][br/]

            When a profile is re-executed from history, it preserves the same applications and
            configurations used at that point in time in order to ensure the consistency of
            operation.

        <new>Replaced log viewer, sys config, Terminal, etc. with Labs page</new>

        <new>Allowed launching non-exported activities in no-root/ADB mode</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            The “Search assistant” (usually set to Google Assistant) feature allows setting
            arbitrary activity via the [tt]assistant[/tt] key-value pair stored in the secure
            settings database. Hence, non-exported (that is, app private) activities can be launched
            even in no-root mode by exploiting this feature. However, modifying a secure setting
            require [tt]android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS[/tt] permission which is granted
            automatically in ADB mode and has to be granted manually in no-root mode via ADB.[br /]

            App Manager also cannot trigger the assistant on its own in the no-root mode, because it
            doesn't have enough permissions (it requires [tt]android.permission.INEJECT_EVENTS[/tt]
            permission which cannot be granted to the user applications). Activity shortcuts also
            use this feature when they cannot be launched in privileged mode.

            “Open links” is displayed for apps capable of opening links from the verified domains
            without any user intervention. This feature, added in Android 12, has raised privacy as

            choice. Therefore, in active state, that is, when the app is able to open the links
            directly, this tag will have a “red” background (otherwise, it will have a “green”
            background).[br /][br /]

            On clicking the tag, a list of supported domains will be displayed in a dialog (although
            not all domains can be opened by default). If the user has enough permissions, an option

            The usage events returned by the [tt]UsageStatsManager[/tt] were assumed to be in order
            of their timestamp which does not seem to be true and resulted in missing a few events
            due to the standard calculation method, that is, calculating the time difference between
            activity resume and pause timestamps. In addition, it appears that the system may log
            activity stop timestamp without logging any pause timestamp (a typical activity cycle
            would be resume → pause → stop → resume → …) causing further miss of events. These
            issues were addressed by sorting the events in order of their timestamp as well as
            measure the time difference between resume and stop timestamps instead of resume and
            pause timestamps.

        <fix>Fixed the “times opened” value</fix>
        <note subtext="true">
            In order to calculate a more reliable number of times an app was opened, the time
            difference between each activity opening and closing are now relaxed. So, when the user
            navigates to another activity from an activity belonging to the same app and the time
            difference is less than 500 ms, the time difference is added to the total usage time.
            This calculation is technically more precise than the system's own open count because
            certain navigation involves the use of system UI (e.g., the arrow in the gesture
            navigation is emitted from the System UI app and should be considered as such) which are
            ignored. However, the issues with choosing 500 ms (half of a second) time difference are
            as follows:[br /]
            1. Due to an user waiting a long time to trigger the back gesture or simply bad coding,
            an app may take more than this time to open an activity which will cause them to be
            listed as two accesses.[br /]
            2. Some apps support multiple windows. If the user opens another activity in a new
            window shortly after opening the first activity, the two accesses may be counted as one
            instead of two.[br /]
            These events are considered extraordinary and can be negligible in a real-life setting.

            - Properly handle backup/restore for a single app. “Custom users” in the backup options

            restore is supported via the “Custom users” option. In addition, fixed issues causing

            - Unless the “Custom users” option is selected, backup or restore is made only for the
            current user in the batch selection mode. Others retain the old behaviour. For example,
            in the batch selection mode, restore is only made with the “base” backup which is
            defined to be the primary backup for the current user. So, if “Custom users” option is
            selected for restore operation, App Manager will try to find the base backup of each
            selected user and restore those for that user.[br /][br /]
            These behaviours are applied throughout the app to reduce complexity and remove

            [tt]uid[/tt]. Any other non-keyword filtering are matched against the log messages

            Android 7 and later[br/]
            - Each keyword takes the intended arguments followed by a [tt]:[/tt] (colon) (e.g.,
            [tt]pid:1[/tt] denotes filtering all the logs produced by the PID 1)[br/]
            - All keywords are [tt]and[/tt]'ed together (e.g., [tt]pid:1651 tag:Ime[/tt] means
            filtering all the logs with the tag containing [tt]Ime[/tt] belonging to the PID 1651)
            [br/]
            - Adding a [tt]-[/tt] (minus) before a keyword denotes exclusion (e.g.,

            - Adding a [tt]=[/tt] (equal) sign before [tt]:[/tt] (colon) denotes an exact match
            (e.g., [tt]tag:Ime[/tt] filters any logs with a tag containing the string [tt]Ime[/tt]
            whereas [tt]tag=:Ime[/tt] filters any logs with a tag that is equal to [tt]Ime[/tt]).
            [tt]pid[/tt] and [tt]uid[/tt] keyword always do an exact match unless it is a string
            or regular expression.[br/]
            - [tt]~[/tt] (tilde) and [tt]=[/tt] (equal) signs are mutually exclusive with [tt]~[/tt]
            (tilde) preferred over [tt]=[/tt] (equal), i.e., when both signs are present, only
            [tt]~[/tt] (tilde) sign is used for regular expression matching[br/]

        <new>Added options to run App Manager in the background</new>
        <note subtext="true">
            In Settings > Privacy, two new options have been added:[br /]
            1. Run App Manager in the background[br /]
            2. Automatic lockdown[br /]
            [br /]

            Running App Manager in the background makes the annoying “Initializing” screen go away.
            Due to possible privacy issues, this option is disabled by default. When automatic
            lockdown is enabled, App Manager will attempt to lock the app by killing its process.
            As expected, there are several side effects:[br /]
            1. All the activities will be closed. They'll be reopened by the system based on how the
            user was interacting with them[br /]
            2. All the running operations as well as scheduled or running jobs will be stopped
            immediately. This might cause data loss if potentially destructive operations are
            running.[br /][br /]

            Note: Enabling the latter option does not wipe the memory of App Manager, i.e., it does
            not prevent a forensic software from scrapping the memory used by App Manager even if
            the process no longer exists.
