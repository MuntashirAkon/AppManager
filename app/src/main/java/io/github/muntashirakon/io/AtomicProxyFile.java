/**
 * Static library support version of the framework's {@link android.util.AtomicFile}, a helper class
 * for performing atomic operations on a file by writing to a new file and renaming it into the
 * place of the original file after the write has successfully completed.
 * <p>
 * Atomic file guarantees file integrity by ensuring that a file has been completely written and
 * sync'd to disk before renaming it to the original file. Previously this is done by renaming the
 * original file to a backup file beforehand, but this approach couldn't handle the case where the
 * file is created for the first time. This class will also handle the backup file created by the
 * old implementation properly.
 * <p>
 * Atomic file does not confer any file locking semantics. Do not use this class when the file may
 * be accessed or modified concurrently by multiple threads or processes. The caller is responsible
 * for ensuring appropriate mutual exclusion invariants whenever it accesses the file.
